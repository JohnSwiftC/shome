# shome

A 'multitool' of several useful and fun commands and modules for devices you might commonly find in a home or on a LAN.

Built modularly, encourages the addition of custom commands and modules.

# Current Features

- Easy command line interface
- AirPlay device creation, flooding, and an AirPlay server

# Future Features

> Why is this idiot making a README for a repo that's 10% complete?

- A stronger and more configurable AirPlay server

- UPnP device discovery
- Act as a UPnP device
- Super niche UPnP man-in-the-middle
- Known UPnP DoS exploit

- Probably some tools for captive portals

# Build

I'm not uploading this to cargo until I get it into a more usable state. For now, `git clone` and `cargo build --release` will have to do.

# This is for fun

This repo is not as useful as a lot of the other things I like making. I'm making the repo out of curiosity for these network devices, and I hope this will help people with similar questions!

If you want to add something fun, PR and tell me what you did. Make sure to hit `cargo fmt --all` before. Super relaxed, I don't care about tests or really much else with this.
